# Code Explanation

## Key Classes and Methods:
SortAscending: Contains the sort method for sorting an array.
<br>
sort method:
Takes an integer array as input.
Uses nested loops to compare and swap elements until the array is sorted.
<br>
main method:
Creates a sample array.
Calls the sort method to sort the array.
Prints the sorted array.
<br>
## Algorithm
The code implements the Bubble Sort algorithm, which works as follows:
1)Iterates through the array multiple times.
2)In each iteration, compares adjacent elements.
3)Swaps elements if they are in the wrong order (descending).
4)Repeats until no more swaps are needed (array is sorted).
<br>
## Time Complexity
Bubble Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which means its performance degrades as the array size increases. For larger arrays, consider using more efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort.
